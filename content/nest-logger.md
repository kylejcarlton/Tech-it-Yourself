Since [Works with Nest (WWN)](https://developers.nest.com/) is retiring, I decided to get set up on [Device Access](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started). There is a lot in these tutorials but I interested in a really functional method of getting data from my Nest thermostat.
